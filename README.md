# 2026 Road to Six

**No more excuses. Ship six projects. Learn by doing.**

## What is this?

This repository is my accountability system for 2026. A personal commitment to stop endlessly
restarting projects and actually ship things that work.

The goal: **6 presentable, deployable, testable projects by December 2026.**

Not perfect. Not revolutionary. Just done.

## Why?

I'm a fullstack web developer who loves coding but struggles with the finish line. I've spent years
cycling through the same pattern:

1. Get excited about a new project or technology
2. Build something cool for a few weeks
3. Hit a wall, lose motivation, abandon
4. Repeat with something "better"

This year, I'm breaking the cycle. Not by forcing myself to never experiment — that's not realistic
— but by having a clear structure that keeps me accountable while leaving room for exploration.

## The Plan

### Semester 1 (January → June)

**Tier 1 Projects** — Must ship:

| Project          | Description                                  | Target      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Trading Journal  | Personal trading log with analytics          | ~2-3 months |
| Car Cost Tracker | Vehicle maintenance & repair expense tracker | ~2-3 months |
| TBD              | Third project to be defined                  | ~2-3 months |

### Semester 2 (July → December)

**Tier 1 Projects** — Must ship:

| Project          | Description                           | Target      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Portfolio + Blog | Showcase projects, document learnings | ~2-3 months |
| TBD              | To be defined from "bone pile"        | ~2-3 months |
| TBD              | To be defined from "bone pile"        | ~2-3 months |

### The "Bone Pile"

These are experiments, explorations, and half-baked ideas. When I need to scratch the itch of
"starting fresh" or "trying something new," I work on these instead of abandoning my Tier 1
projects.

The rule: **I can chew on a bone, but I always come back to the steak.**

Some bones may graduate to Tier 1 in Semester 2. Most won't. That's fine.

## Philosophy

### On finishing

"Presentable" doesn't mean perfect. It means:

- Someone else can use it
- It's deployed somewhere accessible
- The core features work
- There's enough documentation to understand what it does

### On learning

I learn by rebuilding. Hexagonal architecture, feature-based folders, Bun, new patterns — I need to
try things multiple ways to really understand them. This repository acknowledges that tendency and
channels it productively.

### On AI assistance

I use AI (Claude) as a **pair-programmer and coach**, not a code generator. The AI guides, explains,
challenges. I write the code. This keeps my skills sharp and my understanding deep.

```

## Tracking Progress

Each project has a JOURNAL.md where I log:

- Date and time spent
- What I worked on
- What I learned or discovered
- Blockers and how I solved them

This isn't about micromanaging myself. It's about having a record I can look back on — proof that
I'm moving forward even when it doesn't feel like it.
