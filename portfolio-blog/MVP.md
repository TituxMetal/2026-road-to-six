# Portfolio + Blog — MVP Definition

## Overview

_What is this project and who is it for?_

Personal portfolio to showcase projects and skills, combined with a dev journal/blog for documenting
learnings and sharing tips. Serves as both a professional showcase and a "bone to chew on" during
low-motivation periods.

## Technical Notes

_Stack, architecture decisions, constraints_

- Likely Astro-based (static site generation, good for SEO)
- Could integrate with this very repo for journal content
- Existing portfolio: `https://portfolio.lang-guillaume.com` (needs review)

## Open Questions

_Things to figure out_

- What's the current state of the existing portfolio?
- Keep it separate or merge with this initiative?
- Blog features: comments? newsletter? just static?
