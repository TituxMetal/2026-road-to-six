# GuardStore — Development Journal

## How to use this file

Log your progress here. Each entry should include:

- **Date**
- **Time spent** (approximate)
- **What you worked on**
- **What you learned/discovered** (optional but valuable)
- **Blockers** (if any)

Don't overthink it. Short entries are fine. The goal is to have a record you can look back on.
