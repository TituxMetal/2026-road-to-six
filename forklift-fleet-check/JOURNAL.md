> **forklift-fleet-check** 1 commit

**Worked on:**

- Repo created on Jan 5, initial project setup committed on Jan 7
- Born from wanting a simpler logistics-themed project for Road to Six — distinct from warehouse-manager which comes from day-job frustration with enterprise WMS systems. ForkliftFleetCheck is about fleet inspection with multi-role access, a more focused and shippable scope.

**Learned:**

- Scoping a project smaller than what you're used to (warehouse-manager is ambitious) makes it more likely to actually ship

**Blockers:**

- None — but no further development yet, focus shifted to car-cost-tracker
