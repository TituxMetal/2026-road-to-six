# 2026 Road to Six

This project is my accountability hub for shipping 6 web projects in 2026.

**Main repository:** `https://github.com/TituxMetal/2026-road-to-six`

## Context

I'm a French fullstack web developer (solo, open source) working to break a pattern of starting
projects but never finishing them. This year, I'm committing to ship 6 presentable, deployable,
testable projects — 3 by June, 3 by December.

## Current Tier 1 Projects (S1)

1. **Trading Journal** — Personal trading log with analytics (Astro, Prisma, SQLite)
2. **Car Cost Tracker** — Vehicle maintenance expense tracker
3. **TBD** — Third project to be defined

## How I work

- **Stack:** NestJS, Prisma, React, Astro, Clean/Hexagonal Architecture
- **Conventions:** Named exports, arrow functions, semantic HTML, English-only docs
- **AI interaction:** Coaching/pair-programming style — guide me, don't write code for me

## What I need from Claude in this project

- Help define MVPs for each project
- Brainstorm features and scope
- Review my plans and challenge my assumptions
- Keep me accountable to the "ship it" mentality
- Discuss technical decisions without implementing them

## Related conversations

Each project may have dedicated conversations for:

- MVP definition
- Technical architecture discussions
- Brainstorming sessions
- Progress check-ins
